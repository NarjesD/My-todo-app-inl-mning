        A Todo List app is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users organize
        their tasks and manage their daily activities efficiently. It allows
        users to create, update, and track tasks in an intuitive interface,
        making it easy to prioritize and stay on top of deadlines. Users can add
        tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them when they're no longer
        needed. It's a great tool for staying organized and focused, both at
        home and at work.
